What do you want to be? I'll help you.

## What is this?

This is a MVVM library for UWP(Universal Windows Platform) Apps.

MVVM pattern is a design pattern to implement sustainable application, especially with XAML.

Since MVVM pattern was introduced on WPF, various documents have explained the importance and effectiveness 
of MVVM pattern, and various MVVM libraries have been proposed for better and easier implementation of your application.

You can find various libraries on nuget: [MVVM Light](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvvmLight/), [Prism.Mvvm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Mvvm), and so on.

However, they are *incredibly fat* to solve various (sometimes trivial) problem and too complicate to learn how to use it.

Do you think the Dependency-Injection feature is really necessary? 

Are you sure you want to use *SomethingLovelyCoolExcellentBlackboxMachine*?

## Phronesis means Practical Wisdom.

Phronesis provides you to very thin but powerful MVVM infrastructure layer.

You perhaps have to write more code with Phronesis compared with the other powerful MVVM library.

However, you can handle more and more phenomenon on your application and framework, and you may touch the heart of the Universal Windows Platform.
